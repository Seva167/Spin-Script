This script works by virtually moving your mouse.<br>
**Fork by dinikai:** bind quit and pause buttons (useful for Counter-Strike) / change speed with '-' and '+' keys

## Instructions

1. Select a rotation type:
   - "rot" - basic rotation
   - "sin" - smooth wave oscillating rotation
   - "tan" - rapid pulsating rotation
   - "sinabs" - smooth pulsating rotation
   - "rand" - instantly turns you by random number of degrees

2. Enter starting delay.

3. Set the speed of your rotation.

4. Press P to pause spin (in "rand" mode difficult to pause).

5. Press '+' or '-" to change rotation speed

And press Q to quit (in "rand" mode hold Q until it closes).
